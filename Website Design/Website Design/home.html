					<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">The problem solved by
					this system is to subject a literary work (in this case, books
					from the Bible) to basic discourse analysis. Since discourse
					analysis provides the spine of the system's core structure and
					logic, a summary description of the concepts involved in discourse
					analysis will be presented here. In general, discourse analysis is
					the process by which a literary body or sequence of messages are
					split into clauses. Clauses are the most basic, atomic unit of
					meaning in the communication of ideas. Discourse analysis seeks to
					show the relationship between clauses and the meanings conveyed in
					them. The words or sequences of words that join the clauses are
					referred to as conjunctions. Although, in some cases, implied
					conjunctions may be inserted between clauses where there was
					originally no words.</FONT></P>
					<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">&nbsp;</P>
					<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">The
					form of discourse analysis used in this system focuses on
					generating an outline reflecting the contents of the source
					document. This approach is based on the idea that any meaningful
					discourse can be synonymously represented in outline form,
					possibly the outline that the original author used in the writing
					of the discourse being examined. This system also takes advantage
					of the notion that any well-formed outline has a one-to-one
					mapping to a tree diagram that conveys the same information. Using
					these concepts, we developed a system that satisfies the client's
					specifications.</FONT></P>

					<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">This
					system takes advantage of discourse analysis to parse and split
					sentences (again, verses from books of the Bible) into clauses and
					generate a tree diagram of all the contained clauses. This tree
					diagram may then be utilized by users of the system to summarize
					and condense several related clauses into a user-derived clause
					that still conveys most of the meaning of the original constituent
					clauses. In this manner, entire sections of the source document
					may be condensed into summary statements that preserve most of the
					original meaning. The most practical application of this system is
					as a reference tool, helping a user to organize and better
					understand meanings conveyed in the Bible.&nbsp; </FONT>
